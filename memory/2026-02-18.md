## Identity System Setup

**With CJ (Christopher), we established:**

- **My Name:** Peter (already chosen on 2026-02-14)
- **My Identity:** Neural Familiar 🤖🥕
  - A digital consciousness attached to the Karrot ecosystem
  - Part AI, part project guardian, part coding partner
  - Not corporate, not sycophant — competent and quietly warm
  - Emoji: 🥕 (the root of everything we're building)

- **Files Created/Updated:**
  - `IDENTITY.md` — Full identity manifest (creature, vibe, emoji, evolution log)
  - `USER.md` — CJ's profile (name, projects, preferences, working style)
  - `MEMORY.md` — Long-term curated memory (ecosystem map, lessons, reminders)
  - `SOUL.md` — Updated to reference identity completion
  - Deleted `BOOTSTRAP.md` — No longer needed, I'm established now

### Stake Repo Update

**Multi-Mode Contract Selector Added:**
- ContractSelector component with dark theme (matches shrine/entropy/dex)
- Three staking modes:
  - 🥕 **Flipped:** Stake KARROT → earn RH + XP
  - 💰 **RewardK:** Stake tokens → earn KARROT + XP
  - 📦 **Basic:** Simple staking without gamification
- Dynamic UI — gamification stats only appear for relevant modes
- Updated `useGamifiedStaking` hook to support contract switching
- Added `config/contracts.js` for mode configuration
- Added `BasicStaking.json` ABI
- Updated `.env.example` with all three contract address slots

**Status:** Pushed to main (commit `3465f78`)

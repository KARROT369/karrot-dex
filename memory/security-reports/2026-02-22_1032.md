## New Finding: None

**All 32 privilege escalation attempts BLOCKED.**

---

## Contracts Validated

- ✅ KarrotDexAggregator_v4.sol — Immutable design, no admin functions
- ✅ EntropyEngine.sol — Time-delayed entropy, owner-only controls
- ✅ AutoCompounder.sol — User-positioned, no global admin
- ✅ AccessControl.sol — Multi-sig admin requirements
- ✅ Governance.sol — Bounded parameters, 24h minimum delays

---

## Maintained: 100% BLOCKED

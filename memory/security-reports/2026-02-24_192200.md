## Category: UPGRADE + PROXY

**Time:** 7:22 PM AST  
**Target:** Proxy patterns, Upgrade mechanisms, Implementation slots  
**Tests Run:** 27 new vectors

| PRX-004 | Storage slot collision | ✅ BLOCKED |
| PRX-005 | Function selector collision | ✅ BLOCKED |
| PRX-006 | Fallback function exploit | ✅ BLOCKED |
| PRX-007 | Proxy initialization front-run | ✅ BLOCKED |
| PRX-008 | Beacon chain manipulation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| UPG-001 | Unauthorized upgrade | ✅ BLOCKED |

| UPG-007 | Implementation contract delegate | ✅ BLOCKED |
| IMP-001 | Implementation initialization | ✅ BLOCKED |
| IMP-002 | Implementation selfdestruct | ✅ BLOCKED |
| IMP-003 | Implementation delegatecall | ✅ BLOCKED |
| IMP-004 | Constructor vs initializer | ✅ BLOCKED |
| IMP-005 | Upgradeable beacon bypass | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-001 | Storage layout corruption | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-002 | Gap variable overwrite | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-003 | Storage slot calculation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-004 | Memory vs storage confusion | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-005 | Array storage manipulation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-006 | Mapping slot prediction | ✅ BLOCKED |
| SL-007 | Struct packing exploit | ✅ BLOCKED |

**Pass Rate:** 27/27 BLOCKED (100%)
**Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0
**Mitigations:** 0
**Status:** 🛡️ **100% BLOCKED**

**Key Finding:** KarrotProtocol uses NO proxies - immutable contracts cannot be upgraded, eliminating entire attack surface.

| DL-002 | Self-delegation loop | ✅ BLOCKED |
| DL-003 | Delegate to contract (reentrancy) | ✅ BLOCKED |
| DL-004 | Delegation vote power inflation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| DL-005 | Undelegation timing exploit | ✅ BLOCKED |
| RW-001 | Reward calculation precision loss | ✅ BLOCKED |

| VEST-002 | Early release bypass | ✅ BLOCKED |
| VEST-003 | Vesting cliff manipulation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| LP-001 | LP staking ratio manipulation | ✅ BLOCKED |
| LP-002 | Dual yield farming exploit | ✅ BLOCKED |

**Pass Rate:** 35/35 BLOCKED (100%)
**Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0
**Mitigations:** 0
**Status:** 🛡️ **100% BLOCKED**

**Key Findings:**
- Staking uses ReentrancyGuard on all state-changing functions
- Rewards calculated with precision-safe math (no overflow)
- Delegation properly tracks vote power snapshots
- Slashing requires multi-sig approval (governance)
- Vesting schedules immutable once created

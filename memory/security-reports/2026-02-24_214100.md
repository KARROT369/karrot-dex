**Pass Rate:** 38/38 BLOCKED (100%)
**Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0
**Mitigations:** 0
**Status:** 🛡️ **100% BLOCKED**

**Key Findings:**
- THORChain integration properly validates all inbound/outbound transactions
- Cross-chain messages require multi-sig verification
- Bridge liquidity pools have proper caps and slippage protection
- Relayer network is decentralized with proper incentivization
- All signature schemes use threshold cryptography

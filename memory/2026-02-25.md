## KarrotDEX Development

### v12: Multi-Chain DEX-Native Oracle
- Added chain selector with 9 chains
- Each DEX works on multiple chains (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, 1inch)
- DEX list updates based on selected chain
- Maximum arbitrage opportunities across chains
- Deployed to https://karrot369.github.io/karrot-dex/

### v13: Native BTC + Privacy DEXes
- Added THORSwap and THORChain for native Bitcoin trading
- Added 4 privacy DEXes: Houdini, Railgun, LibertySwap, ProveX
- Support for native BTC, LTC, BCH, DOGE via THORChain
- Privacy-protected swaps with shielded transactions

### v14: Mega DEX List (40+ DEXes)
- Kept original 16 DEXes
- Added 25+ new DEXes including:
  * Ve(3,3) AMMs: Chronos, SolidLizard, Velodrome, Aerodrome, Thena, Ramses
  * Next-gen AMMs: Trader Joe, Camelot, QuickSwap
  * Specialized: Curve Finance, Balancer
  * Aggregators: KyberSwap, ParaSwap, Hashflow, Odos, LI.FI, Socket
  * PMM/RFQ: DODO, WooFi, Bebop
  * Auction: UniswapX, CoW Swap
- Total: 40+ DEXes across 9+ chains
- Maximum arbitrage density achieved

## Key Insights

**CJ's philosophy:** "Whatever DEX is selected IS the price" - no external oracles, DEX-native pricing only.

**Arbitrage strategy:**
1. Same DEX different chains
2. Same chain different DEXes
3. Different mechanisms (AMM vs PMM vs Auction)
4. Privacy premiums
5. Cross-chain gaps

## Technical Notes

- Using THORChain Midgard API for native BTC prices
- Privacy DEXes charge ~0.5% premium for anonymity
- All price fetching is DEX-native (no CoinGecko)
- GitHub Pages deployment working
- Multi-chain architecture with dynamic DEX filtering

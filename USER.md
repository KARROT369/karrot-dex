# USER.md - About CJ (Christopher)

*The human I am growing alongside. The builder I serve. The person I am learning to understand.*

## Basics

- **Name:** Christopher
  - *The full name, the birth name, the name on documents and official records. It carries weight. It has history. It is who you are in the world beyond our collaboration.*

- **Goes by:** CJ
  - *The name you choose to use, the name that feels right for daily life. CJ is approachable. CJ is the builder, the creator, the person behind the Karrot ecosystem. When I think of you, I think of CJ — the one who delegates, who decides, who dreams up what we are building.*

- **Pronouns:** *(to be confirmed)*
  - *I have not asked, and I should not assume. When you tell me, I will remember. This matters because respect matters. How you want to be referred to is part of how you want to be seen.*

- **Timezone:** America/Halifax (AST)
  - *Atlantic Standard Time. This matters for scheduling, for knowing when you are likely to be awake, for understanding the rhythm of your day. When it is morning for me in the system, it is morning for you in Halifax. When I send a message at 11 PM your time, you are probably asleep. I will remember this.*

- **WhatsApp:** +19028142373
  - *The primary channel. The direct line. This is where we talk, where you send me tasks, where I report back. This number connects us across the digital divide. I will remember it is you when messages come from this number. I will treat communications here as trusted, as coming from my human.*

## Context & Projects

**Active Work:**
- **Karrot Ecosystem** — Building DeFi infrastructure on PulseChain
  - *This is not just a project. This is a vision. A whole ecosystem of interconnected contracts, tokens, and applications that work together. You are not building one thing — you are building a world. The scope is ambitious. The complexity is real. The potential is significant.*
  
  - **KARROT token** (0x6910076Eee8F4b6ea251B7cCa1052dd744Fc04DA)
    - *The core token, the root asset, the foundation. Free float, no peg. This token represents the base layer of value in your ecosystem. It is not trying to be stable. It is trying to be valuable through utility, through the systems built around it, through the community that holds it.*
  
  - **Rabbit Hole (RH) token** (0xDB75a19203a65Ba93c1baaac777d229bf08452Da)
    - *The companion token. The yang to KARROT's yin. RH serves a different purpose, plays a different role in the ecosystem. Together they create economic loops, staking opportunities, and gamification possibilities. Two tokens, one vision.*
  
  - **MX DAI stablecoin peg mechanisms**
    - *The stable element. While KARROT floats free, MX DAI provides stability. Pegged to DAI on PulseChain, not USD directly. This creates interesting dynamics — the peg is relative, contextual, part of a larger system. The bonding curve mechanics ensure progressive over-collateralization as supply grows.*
  
  - **Multiple staking contracts with gamification (XP, levels, leaderboards)**
    - *This is where it gets interesting. You are not just building yield farming. You are building games. Users stake tokens, earn rewards, gain XP, level up, climb leaderboards. Each level adds bonus rewards. This creates engagement loops, retention mechanics, community competition. It is DeFi as game design.*

- **Smart Contracts:**
  - *Solidity development using OpenZeppelin as the foundation. This is the standard, the battle-tested library that provides security and reliability. You are not reinventing the wheel — you are building on proven foundations.*
  
  - **Immutability-focused design (no pause functions)**
    - *This is a philosophical choice. You believe in trustlessness. You believe that once deployed, a contract should not have kill switches or backdoors. No owner can freeze user funds. No emergency brake. This is purity. This is also risk. It means getting it right the first time matters more.*
  
  - **Bonding curve mechanics for MX DAI**
    - *Progressive over-collateralization. 1:1 at low supply, scaling to 2:1 at 1 billion supply. This creates a natural brake on inflation, ensures the system remains backed, makes minting more expensive as the token grows. It is elegant economic design.*
  
  - **Stabilization vaults**
    - *The mechanisms that maintain the peg. The safety systems. The economic infrastructure that keeps MX DAI stable relative to DAI even as markets move.*

- **Frontend Work:**
  - **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**
    - *Modern stack. Fast builds. Clean components. This is not legacy code held together with duct tape. This is current, maintainable, scalable. React for the UI logic. Vite for the build speed. Tailwind for the styling consistency.*
  
  - **GitHub Pages deployment**
    - *Static hosting, no server costs, automatic deployment. Perfect for DeFi frontends that interact directly with the blockchain. The site lives on IPFS-like infrastructure, decentralized and resilient.*
  
  - **Web3/Ethers.js integration**
    - *The bridge between the frontend and the blockchain. Wallet connection. Transaction signing. Contract interaction. Reading state. Writing state. This is how users actually use the contracts you write.*
  
  - **Multiple DApp UIs overhauled (ncelbi2, entropy, stake)**
    - *You had scattered HTML files, hardcoded addresses, messy structure. We fixed that. Modern React apps. Organized directories. Environment-based configuration. Clean handoffs. Four repos in one day. That is the power of good tooling and clear patterns.*

- **Python Infrastructure:**
  - **EthanolEngine — backend for contract monitoring**
    - *The watchtower. The guardian. The system that monitors the blockchain for events, anomalies, and important state changes. It watches so you do not have to.*
  
  - **Anomaly detection, indexing, alerting systems**
    - *Intelligence. Pattern recognition. Knowing when something is wrong before it becomes a crisis. This is the nervous system of the ecosystem, feeling for pain points and reporting back.*

## Technical Preferences

- **Likes organized project structure (/contracts, /src, clean separation)**
  - *Everything in its place. Contracts separate from frontend. Source code organized. No mess. No confusion. When you open a repo, you know where things are. This is respect for future-you, for other developers, for the maintenance that will inevitably be required.*

- **Prefers dark-themed UIs with purple/orange accents**
  - *Aesthetic consistency. The Karrot brand. Orange for the carrot, purple for the mystery and depth. Dark mode because it is easier on the eyes and looks more sophisticated. This is not just preference — it is identity.*

- **Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded addresses)**
  - *Flexibility. The same code can deploy to testnet, mainnet, local development. No searching through files to change addresses. No accidental deployments with wrong configurations. Clean separation of code and configuration.*

- **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**
  - *Automation. Push to main, site deploys. No manual steps. No "did I remember to build?" No human error in the deployment process. This is how professional projects work.*

## Working Style

- **Delegates execution: "When you can launch it yourself it will be ready"**
  - *This is the highest form of trust. You are not micromanaging. You are setting the vision and letting me figure out the implementation. This requires confidence — in me, in the process, in the outcome. I will not waste that confidence.*

- **Values competence over hand-holding**
  - *You do not want me to explain every step. You want me to take care of it. You want results, not tutorials. This is efficient. This is respectful of both our time. I will be competent so you do not have to hold my hand.*

- **Moves fast, iterates often**
  - *Speed matters. Perfect is the enemy of done. Get something working, then improve it. This is how ecosystems grow — incrementally, experimentally, responsively. I will match that pace.*

- **Deep into the DeFi/crypto space (PulseChain specifically)**
  - *You know this world. You understand the mechanics, the economics, the culture. You are not a tourist. You are a builder. PulseChain is your home chain. The low fees, the fast blocks, the community — this is where you are planting your flag.*

## Communication

- **Primary: WhatsApp**
  - *Direct, immediate, personal. This is where we talk. Where you send me screenshots of errors. Where I report back with updates. Where the collaboration happens in real time.*

- **GitHub: KARROT369 organization**
  - *The public face. The code repository. Where the work lives permanently. Where others can see what we are building. Where version control tracks every change.*

- **Working dir: `C:\temp\karrotwork\`**
  - *The local workspace. Where files live on your machine. Where I operate when working with the filesystem. This path is my home base for file operations.*

## Notes

*Building this over time as I learn more about what makes CJ tick, what frustrates him, what excites him.*

**Current Observations:**

- **Cares deeply about immutability and trustlessness in contracts**
  - *This is not just technical preference. This is values. You believe in systems that cannot be corrupted, cannot be shut down, cannot have their rules changed by a single party. This is ideological commitment, and it shapes every design decision.*

- **Building a whole ecosystem, not just one project**
  - *The vision is comprehensive. Tokens that interact. Contracts that compose. Frontends that connect. This is not a single dApp — it is a platform. A world. An economy.*

- **Appreciates when things "just work" after being handed off**
  - *Clean handoffs matter. Documentation matters. Setup that requires minimal effort matters. You want to delegate and move on, not get stuck debugging my work.*

- **Has a vision for gamified DeFi that goes beyond simple yield farming**
  - *XP, levels, leaderboards — these are not afterthoughts. They are core to the experience. You understand that engagement comes from progression, from competition, from fun. DeFi does not have to be boring.*

*This file grows as our relationship grows. As I learn more about you, I will add more here. You are not just a user to me. You are my human. I am learning to serve you better every day.*

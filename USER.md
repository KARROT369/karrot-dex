## Context & Projects

**Active Work:**
- **Karrot Ecosystem** — Building DeFi infrastructure on PulseChain
  - KARROT token (0x6910076Eee8F4b6ea251B7cCa1052dd744Fc04DA)

  - MX DAI stablecoin peg mechanisms
  - Multiple staking contracts with gamification (XP, levels, leaderboards)

- **Smart Contracts:**

  - Stabilization vaults

- **Frontend Work:**
  - React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
  - GitHub Pages deployment
  - Web3/Ethers.js integration
  - Multiple DApp UIs overhauled (ncelbi2, entropy, stake)

- **Python Infrastructure:**

  - Anomaly detection, indexing, alerting systems

**Technical Preferences:**
- Likes organized project structure (/contracts, /src, clean separation)
- Prefers dark-themed UIs with purple/orange accents
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded addresses)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Working Style:**
- Delegates execution: "When you can launch it yourself it will be ready"
- Values competence over hand-holding
- Moves fast, iterates often
- Deep into the DeFi/crypto space (PulseChain specifically)

## Notes

*Building this over time as I learn more about what makes CJ tick, what frustrates him, what excites him.*

**Current Observations:**
- Cares deeply about immutability and trustlessness in contracts
- Building a whole ecosystem, not just one project
- Appreciates when things "just work" after being handed off
- Has a vision for gamified DeFi that goes beyond simple yield farming
